    time: Jul 2023 – Present
    company: Baum Design Systems
    details: |
      - Delivered >7× runtime speedup in a critical elaboration stage via lazy evaluation and caching.
      - Reduced matching runtime by >90% (4h 38m → 25m 38s) by removing unnecessary allocations/copies and applying selective lazy evaluation.
      - Improved core database efficiency: -13.5% memory and +12% runtime via data-structure redesign.
      - Built simulation-driven logical inversion detection to improve analysis QoR and throughput; reduced overhead with time-window selection and bitset-based filtering.
      - Implemented flexible custom power derating for multi-scenario analysis using hierarchical inheritance and override precedence.
      - <TODO: Add concrete “how” details for runtime optimization (profiling evidence, algorithmic complexity deltas, cache key/invalidation strategy).>
